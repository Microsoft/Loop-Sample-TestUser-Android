# Loop Android Sample - Setting up test users

These instructions will get you a copy of a Loop sample app for pulling user profiles up and running for development and testing purposes.

1. If you havenâ€™t already, signup for a loop account (it takes seconds - https://developer.dev.loop.ms/) 
2. Create a new app to get your loop app key and secret token
3. Clone this sample app (`git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/Loop-Sample-TestUser-Android.git`), and open it in Android Studio. Replace the `your_app_id` and `your_app_token` constant in `LoopHelloApplication.java` with your loop app key and secret token.
4. Create test users in your user dashboard (user link in the left navigation)
5. Replace the `your_test_userid` with your test user id.
6. Run the app. 

After this is done, you can send create test profiles from the dashboard and see them updated in your app. This is similar to Loop creating home & work profiles, and updating your app.
