# Loop Android Sample - Setting up test users

These instructions will get you a copy of a Loop sample app for pulling user profiles up and running for development and testing purposes.

1. If you haven’t already, signup for a loop accountit takes seconds - https://developer.dev.loop.ms/ 
2. Create test users by clicking on the Users tab on the left. We will populate test users with sample trips and home/work profile (fyi - the walkthrough will just include test signals). 
3. Clone this sample app (`git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/Loop-Sample-TestUser-Android.git`), and open it in Android Studio. Replace the `your_app_id` and `your_app_token` constant in the `LoopHelloApplication` with your loop key and secret token. 
4. Replace the `your_test_userid` with an id of a test user you’re generating. 
5. Go back to your dashboard, and open the test user profile. Send a test signal.
6. Run the app. 

After this is done, you can pull test user profiles from your app!
